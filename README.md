Our goal is to create a game similar to Google Chrome's Dinosaur Run game. Objectives:

Create a player that can jump using keyboard input, and UI input. (UI input will likely only work on the phone itself)

Make an environment so that the character doesn't look static: Moving ground, moving background, etc..

Draw some obstacles for the player to jump over

Write code so that the obstacles move toward the player, and have them collide with the player

Design a beautiful user interface for the player including things such as: health, score, money, etc..

Get the app on the Android Play Store!
